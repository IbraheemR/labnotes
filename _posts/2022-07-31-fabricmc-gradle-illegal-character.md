title: "FabricMC/Gradle: Illegal character ((CTRL-CHAR, code 31))"
---

## Context:

- Creating a new fabric mod from fabricmc/fabric-example-mod
- Using IDEA community edition on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Note: this was typed in a hurry, might be slightly inaccurate (I'm a java noob)

## Symtoms:

An error message like the followning, which would happen for any gradle task.

Additionally, could not even run `gradle clean`, which usually fixes weird errors.
