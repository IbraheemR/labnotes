## The vast majority of problems can be solved with a little bit of Googling and patience.

However for some problems finding the solution requires extensive forum-trawling, debugging and keyboard slamming.

This can be because of:
- Poor documentation
- Esoteric subject matter
- An extreemly specific combination of hardware, software stack, config options, etc. (especially for Linux)

I aim to document problems I've solved which are "non-trivial", as well the context in which I encountered them (which is just as important).

**Hopefully they help someone at somepoint.**
