## Most problems are solved with a little Googling and patience.

However finding some solutions requires extensive forum-trawling, debugging and keyboard slamming (even if the solution itself is super simple)

This can be because of:
- Poor documentation
- Esoteric subject matter
- An extremely specific situation (e.g combination of hardware, software, config)
- Not knowing the words people usually use to describe your problem.

Below are solutions which were unreasonably hard to find, and how I tried (and failed) to find them.

**Hopefully this makes things easier for someone at somepoint.**
